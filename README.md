qtchan is a 4chan browser written with qt5.\
I started developing it because browsers suck.\
There's still a lot to do.


# Features
* browse and post on 4chan
* auto update threads and auto download original file
* download all media as original filename
* tree style tabs and save state (./session.txt)
* open files in OS's default application
* search and filter
* filter by regexp$options
* self-archive
* (You)

### Build Instructions (Linux/BSD based)
How your dependencies are packaged will vary from distro to distro and which BSD you're using. The only packages you need to compile qtchan are qt5, qt5-devel, qt5-qmake for the proper version of qmake, make (The full build-essentials which also packages make is not truly required), and a compiler of your choice such as gcc or clang. Gcc is not a hard dependency. After that just do the following:.
```
git clone https://github.com/siavash119/qtchan 
cd qtchan
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../
make
./qtchan
```

Archlinux:
```
makepkg --install
```
or from AUR:
```
packer -S qtchan
```

there are more shortcuts; look at the source for now for info.

keybinds other than 1-9 (vim #), ctrl+F1-F4 (save session slot), and shift+F1-F4 (load session slot) are configurable. Set them in your qtchan.ini file like this and restart qtchan
```

nextTab=ctrl+tab
firstTab=ctrl+1
prevParent=ctrl+2

closeTab2=delete
navBar=ctrl+l

```

need to restart qtchan if changing to use 4chan pass or not. signals/slots still not finished for that.

## Captcha
1. in the post form, focus the bottom lineEdit. It will load the challenge image
2. it's a grid following the numpad:
* 7 8 9
* 4 5 6
* 1 2 3
3. type in the numbers and hit enter (e.g. 034)
4. if it says "Verified.", you're good to post.
* Your code will expire in 2 minutes. If you want to load a new captcha, hit enter in the lineEdit or click the image.

Note: the numbers in this image follow a previous captcha number grid, the correct answer would be 893 in any order.

## Filters
Create a file ~/.config/qtchan/filters.conf
```
!key
regex (don't surround with or escape forward slashes; always case insensitive)
regex
regex$option:value,value;option:value
#comment
!

!sub
/yourbadgeneral/$boards:g,pol;op:only
##all generals
general$op:only
!

!name
##name users
^(?!Anonymous$)$
!

!filename
##fap
#^$$
##work
#^(?!$)$
!
```
F7 reloads and applies the filters.conf file

## Using 4chan pass to post
Create a file ~/.config/qtchan/cookies.conf like below. Look at your browser cookies for values.
Open settings with Ctrl+P and check Use 4chan pass.
```
4chan_pass:your_4chanpass
pass_id:your_pass_id
pass_enabled:1
```

## Extra flags for int
In ~/.config/qtchan/qtchan.ini add these lines. Don't put your country name:
```
[extraFlags]
enable=true
region=YourRegion||SubRegion||another
```
